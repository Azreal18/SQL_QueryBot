# SQL_QueryBot

This Jupyter notebook, SQL Chat.ipynb, is a Python script that is used to interact with SQL databases. It uses several Python libraries to establish a connection with the database, execute SQL queries, and handle the results.

## Libraries Used

- pandas: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It is particularly useful for working with numerical tables and time series data.

- sqlalchemy: SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, which provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns. It is used here to create an engine and a sessionmaker. The engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application, while the sessionmaker is a factory for creating new Session objects which are the primary interface for persistence operations.

- google.colab: This is a library for Google Colaboratory that allows you to interact with the environment, including uploading and downloading files.

## How to Use

To use this notebook, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Create an engine using the `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy. This requires a connection string that specifies the type of database and other connection parameters.
3. Create a sessionmaker using the `sessionmaker` function, which is bound to the engine.
4. Use the sessionmaker to create new Session objects, which can be used to execute SQL queries and handle the results.
5. Use the files module from google.colab to upload or download files as needed.

Please note that this is a general overview and the actual usage may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
